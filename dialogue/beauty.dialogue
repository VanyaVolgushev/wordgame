Maria: Hehehe I have a rather high pitched voice.
Maria: Also, my placeholder is pink?
Maria: You know, Simone de Beauvoir once said, "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman."
Maria: [[It's absurd|It's fascinating|It pisses me off]] how society assigns meaning to pitch and color like they're part of some metaphysical essence.
Maria: Just because my voice is high doesn't mean I'm fragile, submissive, or cute—whatever that even means.
Maria: Pink? What, does that automatically put me in the 'nurturing' category?
Maria: De Beauvoir argued that femininity is a social construct—an identity molded by culture and expectation, not biology.
Maria: [[She was right|And she nailed it|It still holds up]]—I'm not some pre-defined "other" just because I don’t growl or wear black.
Maria: People hear a voice like mine and instantly slot it into some dumb mental filing cabinet labeled "girl stuff."
Maria: But here's the kicker: that mental cabinet was built by centuries of conditioning and philosophical laziness.
Maria: [[Wake up|Think critically|Challenge it]], will you?
