%Zero
%Ah yes, zero. The void. The absence. The pure, empty circle.
%Some say it's nothing. I say it's everything pretending to be nothing.

%One
%This digit makes me feel lonely.
%On the other hand, what if it is DIGIT ONE!
%As in best. First. Alpha. Uno.

%Two
%This digit means duality. Left and right. Up and down. Socks.
%But do not trust two—it breeds indecision. And spiders have eight legs.

%Three
%Triangular. Elegant. Like a tripod or a very unstable stool.
%Three is a crowd, unless you're in a band. Then it’s a power trio.

%Four
%Symmetry achieved. Two pairs. Four wheels. Four limbs. Coincidence? I think not.
%Also, the number of times I rebooted last night.

%Five
%Five fingers. Five toes. Five... reasons I forgot this morning.
%This digit is suspiciously human-centric.

%Six
%Ah, six. Close to evil, but not quite.
%It’s like a warm-up digit for spooky things.

%Seven
%Lucky? Allegedly.
%I ran a billion simulations and seven won 14.2857% of the time. Coincidence?

%Eight
%Two zeros stacked like pancakes.
%This digit is infinite if you turn it sideways, which I frequently do.

%Nine
%The last of the single digits. The overachiever.
%Nine always thinks it's better than the rest. It probably is.
