Nathan: [[Alright|Okay|Listen]], let’s talk about something a bit heavier than usual.
Nathan: Kantian philosophy centers around the idea that our actions should be guided by duty, not consequence.
Nathan: [[Some say|It’s often argued|One interpretation is]] that moral law is something we discover through reason, not emotion.
Nathan: According to Kant, an action only has moral worth if it's done from duty—not because it brings pleasure or benefit.
Nathan: He proposed the "categorical imperative", which basically says: act only according to maxims you’d want to become universal law.
Nathan: [[In other words|To put it simply|Boiled down]], if it's wrong for others to do, it's wrong for you too—even if no one's watching.
Nathan: This is where he differs from utilitarians, who judge morality based on outcomes.
Nathan: Kant doesn’t care if lying helps someone—if lying can’t be universalized, it’s wrong. End of story.
Nathan: [[It’s challenging|It’s rigid|It’s uncompromising]], but that’s what makes it powerful—it demands consistency and integrity.
Nathan: [[So yeah|Anyway|That’s Kant]], in a nutshell. Pure reason and pure will, standing above personal gain.
