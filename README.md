Game where you learn new words by doing mouth gymnastics every day.

Currently there's NPC speech bubbles with a limited response time, response UI that pops up when you click the bubbles and a system for evaluating the sentence you respond with. If an evaluatioin wasnt found on file you can evaluate your sentence ingame with a debug popup that edits the file with evaluations. Later I plan to have NPCs react to your sentence depending on its qualities and context words you use. Most common word combinations can have evaluations stored on file and more specific and long combinations can be evaluated on the fly by a small LLM embedded into the game.
